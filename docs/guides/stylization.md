# Stylization

You can stylize any part of the interface of JavaScript Event Calendar to meet your project requirements. For this, the library provides a wide range of CSS variables. Note, that Event Calendar includes two types of variables:
- CSS variables related to **Event Calendar** style
- CSS variables related to the **WX** library style (*controls, calendars etc*)

:::info
Note, that **WX** library is used for inner processes only. It provides some small elements used in Event Calendar (*controls, calendars etc*)
:::

## Default style

~~~css
.wx-material-theme,
.wx-portal {
/* Event Calendar css variables */

}
~~~

:::tip Note
Next versions of Event Calendar can bring some changes for the variables and their names. Please, do not forget to check the names after updating to the newer versions and modify them in your code to avoid problems with display of the component.
