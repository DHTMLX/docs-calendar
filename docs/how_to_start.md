# How to start

This clear and comprehensive tutorial will guide your through the steps you need to take in order to get a full-functional Event Calendar on a page.

## Step 1. Including source files

Start from creating an HTML file and call it *index.html*. Then proceed to include Event Calendar source files into the created file.

There are two necessary files:

- the *JS* file of Event Calendar
- the *CSS* file of Event Calendar

~~~html {5-6} title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>How to Start with Event Calendar</title>
		<script src="./dist/event-calendar.js"></script>   
		<link href="./dist/event-calendar.css" rel="stylesheet">
	</head>
	<body>
		<script>
		// your code will be here
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
~~~

:::info
You can also import Event Calendar into your project using `yarn` or `npm` commands. To get the trial version of Event Calendar, run the following commands:

~~~jsx {2-3,6-7}
// npm
npm config set @dhx:registry https://npm.dhtmlx.com
npm i @dhx/trial-eventcalendar

// yarn
yarn config set @dhx:registry https://npm.dhtmlx.com
yarn add @dhx/trial-eventcalendar
~~~

To get Event Calendar under the proprietary license, refer to **[Support Center](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/technical-support.shtml)**!

:::tip
If you want to integrate JavaScript Event Calendar into React, Angular or Vue projects, refer to the corresponding [**Examples on CodeSandbox**](https://codesandbox.io/u/DHTMLX) for more information.

## Step 2. Creating Event Calendar

Now you are ready to add Event Calendar to the page. For this you need to take the following steps:

- specify a DIV container in the *index.html* file
- initialize component using the `eventCalendar.EventCalendar()` constructor

The constructor takes an ID of HTML container where Event Calendar will be placed into and an object with the corresponding configuration properties. See an example below:

~~~html {9,11-46} title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>How to Start with Event Calendar</title>
		<script src="./dist/event-calendar.js"></script>   
		<link href="./dist/event-calendar.css" rel="stylesheet">  
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="root"></div>
		<script>
			new eventCalendar.EventCalendar("#root", {
				// configuration properties
				mode: "month",
				date: new Date("2023-03-12T00:00:00"),
				events: [
					{
						id: "1",
						type: "work",
						start_date: new Date("2023-03-23T08:00:00"),
						end_date: new Date("2023-03-23T10:25:00"),
						text: "French Open",
						details: "Philippe-Chatrier Court\n Paris, FRA"
					},
					{
						id: "2",
						type: "work",
						start_date: new Date("2023-03-08T00:00:00"),
						end_date: new Date("2023-03-13T00:00:00"),
						text: "French Open",
						details: "Philippe-Chatrier Court\n Paris, FRA",
					},
					{
						id: "3",
						type: "work",
						start_date: new Date("2023-02-21T00:00:00"),
						end_date: new Date("2023-03-16T00:00:00"),
						text: "Wimbledon",
						details: "Wimbledon\n June 21, 2009 - July 5, 2009",
						color: {
							background: "#BD69BC",
							border: "#AD44AB",
							textColor: "#FFFFFF"
						},
					}
				]
			});
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
~~~

Refer to the following properties to get more info on how to provide initial data for **events**, specify initially displayed **date** and **view mode**:

- [`events`](../api/config/js_eventcalendar_events_config)
- [`date`](../api/config/js_eventcalendar_date_config)
- [`mode`](../api/config/js_eventcalendar_mode_config)

Refer to the [Working with data](../guides/working_with_data) guide, to find more info on supported data format.

## Step 3. Configuring Event Calendar

Next you can specify the configuration properties you want the Event Calendar component to have when initialized.

~~~jsx {2-12}
new eventCalendar.EventCalendar("#root", {
	calendars,
	colors,
	config,
	date,
	editorShape,
	events,
	locale,
	mode,
	sidebar,
	templates,
	theme
});
~~~

You can find all supported properties on the following page: [API Overview](../api/overview/properties_overview)

To get to know how all properties are used together, check the [Configuration](../guides/configuration) guide.

If you want to connect **EventCalendar** to REST API, refer to the [Working with server](../guides/working_with_server) guide.
