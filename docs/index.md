# DHTMLX Scheduler overview

JavaScript Scheduler is a modern web tool for time-management and scheduling events. It perfectly works on both desktop and mobile platforms. This solution helps users manage their schedule and plane new appointments by adding single or recurring events. It is also possible to reschedule all events using drag-n-drop. The appropriate display modes will help to look through the events scheduled for a day, week or month.
